While my main dev/design task was [the Sanibit UI](/posts/2019-sanibit-ui) at Microsensor Labs, I also ended updating the company's marketing site. The old design was [functional](https://web.archive.org/web/20190206154940/http://www.microsensorlabs.com/), but we saw an opportunity to leave an impression with something more modern.

On the dev side, what started out as a basic [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) + [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) site eventually grew to a whole [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) thing as the need for a blog came up.

On the design side, I inherited our logo and ran with it. From the logo, I took its colors and its inspiration of water and technology. From that, I tried to build something that felt both natural and cutting-edge. It's no stripe.com, but for a developer's design work, it ended up passable! Without looking it up, I can still tell you: [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito), [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato), {% color color="#12354E" %}#12354E{% /color %}, and {% color color="#F99D25" %}#F99D25{% /color %}.

There's also this really fun wristband animation that I spent a lifetime trying to make in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). (Without ever having used Blender.)
