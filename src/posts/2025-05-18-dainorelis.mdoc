title: "Dainorėlis: your Lithuanian songbook"
type: build
previewText: I grew up singing Lithuanian songs by the campfire. So it meant a lot to me to take over the Dainorėlis app. I rewrote it in React Native, updated its design, added hundreds of new songs, and added ways for people to learn through chords, sheet music, and recordings.
