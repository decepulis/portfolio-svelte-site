I'm really excited this one took off. It wan't anything special. Just sharing my thoughts and observations. But it came at the right place, right time.

And oh my gosh. [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXPoTD721qc) talked about it? [Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components#where-do-you-go-from-here) linked to me and then had me at [Next.js Conf](/posts/2023-08-26-nextjs-conf)? [Pod Rocket](https://podrocket.logrocket.com/migrating-50000-lines-of-code-to-rscs-darius-cepulis) had me on? It made it to the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37345727)? So exciting.
