My buddy realized that testing in the beer industry sorely needed an upgrade. So, he took his chemistry degree and set to it. 

Of course, what's a good business without a good marketing website? And I was just starting out as a web developer, so I offered to help. 

All I had to go on was the logo, which gave me some colors, some shapes, and a font. I used that to try and create a simple, clean, modern design. (Of course, I'm not really a designer, so "simple and clean" is about all I can manage.) Of course, around the same time, [Netlify](https://web.archive.org/web/20181231203204/https://www.netlify.com/) and others had this really cool wave aesthetic that I was really into and wanted to try out. So I did.

And, of course, if know you me, you know that I've never gotten over [that amazing parallax effect on the Firewatch website](https://www.firewatchgame.com), so I had to get some parallax in there, too.

Over time, the site grew. It started out as a basic [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) site. Now, it's written in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). It was also a great chance to learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a tool I have come to understand and enjoy, [even in production](https://www.mux.com/blog/the-building-blocks-of-great-docs#tailwind-css). The content comes from [Prismic](https://prismic.io). It used to be hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), but now it's on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).


And I've built some cool illustrations, too! For example, there's this totally extra [qPCR](https://www.midwestmicrobio.com/qpcr) visualization that I built with my favorite charting library, [pancake](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/pancake)

Or, this over-the-top assay visualization built with [D3](https://d3js.org)

Not sure going that hard was necessary, but it sure was fun!
